## First Launch

When you first launch Traq, it will:

1. Create a data directory at `~/.local/share/traq/`
2. Initialize the SQLite database
3. Start capturing screenshots automatically

## Basic Usage

### Timeline View

The main view shows your activity timeline:
- A calendar heatmap showing activity by day
- Click any day to see session breakdowns
- Browse screenshots from specific time periods
