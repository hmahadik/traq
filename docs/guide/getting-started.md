# Getting Started

## Installation

See the [Download](/download) page for installation instructions.

## First Launch

When you first launch Traq, it will:

1. Create a data directory at `~/.local/share/traq/`
2. Initialize the SQLite database
3. Start capturing screenshots automatically

## Basic Usage

### Dashboard

The main dashboard shows:
- Today's activity summary
- Recent screenshots with timestamps
- Quick stats (active time, sessions, screenshots captured)

### Timeline View

Click on **Timeline** in the navigation to see:
- A calendar heatmap showing activity by day
- Click any day to see session breakdowns
- Browse screenshots from specific time periods

### Analytics

The **Analytics** view provides:
- Charts showing time spent per application
- Activity patterns by hour and day of week
- Trends over time

### Settings

Access **Settings** to configure:
- Capture interval (how often to take screenshots)
- Image quality and format
- AFK timeout duration

## Stopping Capture

To temporarily pause screenshot capture:
