- All frontend components (8 components created)
- Categorization settings UI
- Loading skeletons
- Runtime safety checks
- All edge cases handled
- All verification steps completed

**No further work required for this feature set.**

### Next Steps (if any)
If there are additional features beyond Timeline v3:
1. Check for new requirements in project documentation
2. Create new feature_list.json for next feature
3. Update app_spec.txt with new objectives

Otherwise, this project phase is complete and ready for deployment.
