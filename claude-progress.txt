- Timeline view fully functional

### What to Work on Next
1. Continue verifying more existing features
2. Focus on P0 core features that may need implementation
3. Consider testing:
   - Reports page functionality
   - Settings persistence
   - Capture functionality (requires enabling capture)

### Notes
- The app has a lot of implemented functionality that just needs verification
- Many tests are for UI components that are already working
- The Force Capture button exists but requires capture daemon to be running for full verification
